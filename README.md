What
===

This is an attempt to adapt Drew Neil's
[Practical Vim](https://pragprog.com/book/dnvim2/practical-vim-second-edition)
tips for editing with `Emacs`. Not claiming to use the fewest keystrokes or
idiomatic workflow. My plan is to roughly follow the order of tips in the
book, occasionally paying attention to
[other interesting bits of advice](https://sanctum.geek.nz/arabesque/vim-anti-patterns/).

- [Tip 1: Repeat the last change](https://gist.github.com/9c7088428031225c023980198dc06b58), as in `vim`'s dot (`.`) command
- [Tip 2: Edit a series of lines at line start-middle-end](https://gist.github.com/7c2521ea993985e1499c0390646886f5)
